### Controls
The A, S, J, K and L keys must be pressed according to the color of the note that is in the "detector". They respectively control the green, red, yellow, blue and orange notes.

### Performance indicator
Located in the left corner, it increases with hits and decreases with misses. If the indicator reaches zero, the game is over.

### Multiplier
Located in the right corner, it indicates how much the points are being multiplied with the hits. If there is an error, the multiplier resets.

### Special bar
Located next to the multiplier, it indicates how much "special" can be used. The special can only be activated when the bar reaches halfway, with the space key.

## How to build
The project already comes with the libs compiled for use in the 64-bit Windows system. Just compile using the settings already defined in the Visual Studio project.
